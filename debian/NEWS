eperl (2.2.14-8) unstable; urgency=low

    For security reasons (see http://bugs.debian.org/57886), the Debian
    package does not provide /usr/lib/cgi-bin/nph-eperl any more, and
    thus ePerl can not be used directly as a server-side scripting
    language in its default configuration.

    If you want to enable this feature, simply type
       ln -sf ../../bin/eperl /usr/lib/cgi-bin/nph-eperl
    as root.
